# SSB Notes

## Overview 

A collection of notes on [Secure Scuttlebutt](https://scuttlebutt.nz) development in an [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) notebook. Created as part of my [SSB Neon](https://timjrobinson.com/ssb-neon) development project. 

Also contains a FAQ page for all sorts of SSB related questions.

I created these to be a reference for anyone who'd like to get into SSB development, they are complimentary to the  [SSB Handbook](https://handbook.scuttlebutt.nz/)

## How to Use

These notes are best viewed using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) as then you'll be able to explore the links between notes with ease.

## Future Ideas

- Find/Create a script that can transform this notebook into a static website, then host with Github Pages. Perhaps something that can reformat it as Hugo notes.
